            Ant-Man is the name of several superheroes appearing in books
            published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and
            Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #35
            (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist
            Hank Pym's superhero alias after inventing a substance that can
            change size, but reformed thieves Scott Lang and Eric O'Grady also
            took on the mantle after the original changed his superhero identity
            to various other aliases, such as Giant-Man, Goliath, and
            Yellowjacket. Pym's Ant-Man is also a founding member of the super
            hero team known as the Avengers. The character has appeared in
            several films based on the Marvel character, such as Ant-Man (2015),
            Captain America: Civil War (2016), Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018),
            Avengers: Endgame (2019) and upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp:
            Quantumania.

              Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and
              Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics
              #1 (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of
              Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic
              supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and
              was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime
              period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and
              the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a
              short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the
              character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

              exist as independent dissociative personalities, and resent each
              other.

              Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
              artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
              Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic
              Books. He has since been featured in movies, television shows,
              video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker,
              an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City
              after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash.
              Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of
              adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting
              characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry
              Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and the
              Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and
              Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from
              a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to
              surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger
              with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted
              "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own
              design.
